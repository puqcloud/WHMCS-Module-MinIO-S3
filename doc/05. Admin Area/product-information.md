The **"Update Policy"** button is used to force the system to select and apply the necessary policy. If there is more than 0 free space on the disk, a permissive policy will be applied; if there is 0 free space on the disk, a restrictive policy will be applied.

The **"Set Standard Policy"** and **"Set Limited Policy"** buttons respectively enforce the application of the standard policy and the limited policy.


Attention, policy recalculation occurs once a day during the collection of server statistics (UpdateServerUsage)
